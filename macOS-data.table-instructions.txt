Instructions for running main.r on macOS; need to be completed BEFORE running library(data.table)...

 1. Go to https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/ and determine which LLVM build matches your architecture and version of macOS.
 2. Open terminal and run the following commands...

curl -O https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/openmp-<matching version>-Release.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz openmp-<matching version>-Release.tar.gz -C /

    Note: You might be asked to enter your password before the second command executes.

 3. Go to https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html and download the binaries for data.table that match your system's architecture.
 4. Run the following command...

PKG_CPPFLAGS='-Xclang -fopenmp' PKG_LIBS=-lomp R CMD INSTALL /path/to/downloaded/binaries/data.table_<version>.tar


Steps 1. and 2. only need to be done once, before running the library(data.table) command for the first time.

Steps 3. and 4. MUST be repeated each time you open main.r in RStudio or you'll get the following message...

data.table 1.14.2 using 1 threads (see ?getDTthreads).  Latest news: r-datatable.com**********This installation of data.table has not detected OpenMP support. It should still work but in single-threaded mode.This is a Mac. Please read https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/. Please engage with Apple and ask them for support. Check r-datatable.com for updates, and our Mac instructions here: https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation. After several years of many reports of installation problems on Mac, it's time to gingerly point out that there have been no similar problems on Windows or Linux.**********

If these instructions do not stop you from getting the above message, please refer to the sites referenced in steps 1. and 3., as well as the sites below...
